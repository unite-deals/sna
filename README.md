SnapAndGo is an innovative web-based attendance management system designed for educational institutions. It simplifies the attendance tracking process by allowing teachers to upload class photos. Our machine learning algorithm then processes these images to mark students as present or absent.

## Features

- **Teacher Interface**: Allows teachers to create groups, upload class photos, and view attendance records.
- **Student Interface**: Students can join groups and view their attendance records.
- **Automatic Attendance Marking**: Machine learning algorithms detect student presence in class photos.
- **Historical Attendance Data**: Attendance for each class is stored and can be accessed by both teachers and students.
- **Secure Authentication**: Ensures data privacy and security for all users.
